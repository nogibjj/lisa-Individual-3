# Project Title: Student Group Event Data ETL Pipeline with Azure Databricks

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Azure Databricks. The primary goal is to perform EAD (Exploratory Data Analysis) work on the data, understanding it better for future use in an NLP (Natural Language Processing) class project. The data transformation work helps prepare the data for subsequent analysis.

## Project Components

### 1. Web Scraping
The initial step involves web scraping using Python packages such as Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and a Firefox web server. This allows for the extraction of data from a student group events webpage, laying the foundation for subsequent ETL processes.

### 2. Databricks Notebook
The project includes a well-documented Databricks notebook, outlining each step of the ETL process. The notebook utilizes Spark SQL for data transformations and demonstrates proficiency in Delta Lake for data storage, showcasing the advantages it offers.

### 3. Delta Lake Usage
Delta Lake is employed for data storage, providing features such as ACID transactions and version control. It seamlessly integrates with Azure Databricks, enhancing data reliability, and enabling the capture of changes over time.

### 4. Spark SQL Transformations
Spark SQL is utilized for efficient data transformations, ensuring the processing of 15,000 event records is both quick and accurate. The distributed computing capabilities of Apache Spark, coupled with the optimization features in Azure Databricks, enhance overall performance.

### 5. Error Handling and Data Validation
The ETL pipeline incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to address potential issues during data extraction, transformation, and loading. Data validation steps are implemented to maintain the integrity and quality of the processed data.

### 6. Visualization
The transformed data is visualized to provide insights and trends. The visualization is detailed in the Databricks notebook, showcasing the significance of the processed information.

### 7. Automated Trigger
The project includes an automated trigger to initiate the ETL pipeline at specified intervals. This ensures the data is regularly updated without manual intervention.
